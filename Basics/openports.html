            <h1>Ports</h1>
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">Ports</a> in networking are an addressing 
                concept that allows computers to send data received over the network to appropriate applications. They take the form
                of a number between 0 and 65535, and when combined with an ip address and transport-layer protocol, they allow one
                host on a network to accurately send data to a specific application on a specific computer elsewhere on the network. 
                The first 1024 ports are considered <em>well known</em> ports and have been officially associated with protocols designed
                for specific services. Common examples are port 80 for http (web browsers direct their requests to this port on a web
                server) or 22 for ssh (an ssh client would target this port to establish a connection and send data).
            </p>
            <p>
                If this is going to work, those servers need to be ready to receive communication on those ports. i.e., the networking
                part of their operating systems should be waiting for any packets addressed to ports 80 or 443, which it will then forward to
                the web server application (and the network's router needs to let those packets through). These well known ports are typically
                used by servers, not clients. If my browser requests a web page, it addresses port 80 on the server, but it takes a 
                random port for its own address. This separation allows us to open multiple tabs in one browser, or multiple browsers with
                multiple tabs, and ensure that each tab gets the correct data. So at any given time, your computer is probably addressing
                a handful of well known ports, but unless you're running a server, it's probably listening on a bunch of random, high-numbered
                ports.
            </p>
            <p>
                So ports essentially help your computer route data segments to the proper applications, ensuring your spotify
                app doesn't get your webpage, and your web browser doesn't get your music stream. That's not particularly dangerous; someone
                can't just find an open port and treat it like a secret entrance to your computer. However, if a well known port is open on a
                computer, that generally means an application is ready to communicate with anyone who reaches out. And that means that it's
                a source of information and possibly exploitation. If you have a version of a web server running with a known vulnerability,
                someone could get that information and then try to find a way to exploit the vulnerability on that web server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of that probably isn't a concern for the average person. But if you happen to be curious and want to 
                view the connections that your computer is establishing with other computers out there in the world, and see what
                ports it's communicating on, the commands below should do the trick.
            </p>
            <h2>Linux (Bash)</Bash></h2>
            <h3>ss</h3>
                <p><span class="item">ss</span> is included in Linux as part of <span class="item">iproute2</span>, the default
                networking tools. It's usage is similar to the familiar <span class="item">netstat</span> (discussed below).
                Here's the command:
                </p>
                <p class="command blk">ss -[l]ntup</p>
                <p>This command shows established connections. Because of this, the <span class="item">-p</span> provides the
                process name and id that established the connection. The <span class="item">-l</span> option shows
                only sockets that are listening, i.e. the port is open to connections, but no connection has been made. 
                <span class="item">-p</span> won't show anything in the latter case because no application has established a connection.
                </p>
            <h3>netstat</h3>
            <p>
                If you go and google about this for a bit, you'll find plenty of recommendations for a popular but dated
                command called <span class="item">netstat</span>. And <span class="item">netstat</span> will certainly get the job
                done, but it - and <span class="item">net-tools</span>, the package it's a part of - has been deprecated in favor
                of <span class="item">ss</span> and <span class="item">iproute2</span>. Not only is
                <span class="item">net-tools</span> no longer maintained, it's not even available
                out-of-the-box in most Linux distributions, while <span class="item">iproute2</span> is. So we'll take a look
                at <span class="item">netstat</span>, but there's no reason to use it at this point.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/netstat.8.html">netstat</a> will show you "network connections, routing tables,
            interface statistics," and more. To view current connections and the open ports associated with them, use the following command:
            </p>
            <p class="command blk">netstat -plntu</p>
            <p><ul>
                <li><span class="item">-p</span> Program name and process id (PID) associated with the socket.</li>
                <li><span class="item">-l</span> Only listening sockets.</li>
                <li><span class="item">-n</span> Shows port numbers instead of protocol or host names. Faster.</li>
                <li><span class="item">-t</span> Shows TCP connections</li>
                <li><span class="item">-u</span> Shows UDP connections</li>
            </ul></p>
            <h2>Windows (Powershell)</h2>
            <p>Like most things in Powershell, there's a long command that, when you see it, makes perfect sense:
                <p class="command blk">Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen</p>
                <p class="command blk">Get-NetUDPEndpoint -LocalAddress &lt;your-ip-address&gt;</p>
                <p>The first command returns all TCP sockets that are currently listening. Without the -State option,
                    the command will return all current TCP sockets and their states. There doesn't seem to be any
                    easy option to show the names of all processes associated with a socket, but 
                    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/57011432"> this answer</a> provides a fine solution:
                </p>
                <p class="command blk">Get-NetTCPConnection | select-Object LocalAddress, LocalPort,RemoteAddress,RemotePort,State , OwningProcess  , @{l="Name" ;e= {Get-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess | select -ExpandProperty Name } } | Format-Table</p>
                <p>The second command above shows all UDP sockets that are open to information. Since UDP is a connectionless
                    protocol, there are no connection statuses listed as in the TCP listing.
                </p>
                <h3>netstat</h3>
                <p>Windows also supports <span class="item">netstat</span>. I can't tell if it's deprecated. It's clearly quite
                old, but still gets the job done. It takes a slightly different form in Windows:</p>
                <p class="command blk">netstat -oanb</p>
                <p><ul>
                    <li><span class="item">-o</span> Shows PID of owning process.</li>
                    <li><span class="item">-a</span> Shows all connections and listening ports.</li>
                    <li><span class="item">-n</span> Speeds things up by printing numbers instead of resolving protocol names</li>
                    <li><span class="item">-b</span> Shows name of executable associated with the port.</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>The output from the above command can be a little much. Use the Powershell command Select-String (sls)
                    to narrow things down:
                </p>
                <p class="command blk">netstat -oanb | sls "LISTENING|UDP"</p>
                <p>This command returns all UDP ports or TCP ports in the "LISTENING" state.</p>
            </p>
